Project Goal:
To model and predict protests across Canada based on data from the last two years through the use of simulation methods.

Details: 
Protests are an important exercise in freedom of speech, but they can also be indicative of broader social unrest. The dataset I will work with counts the number of protests per month per province across Canada in 2022 and 2023. One of the ways to model counts data is to use the Poisson distribution. I will use simulation methods from this course to test for significance of parameters and predict the expected number of protests across Canada in 2025

Data Source: 
The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), https://acleddata.com/ and Statistics Canada for provincial populations

We can see that Ontario has far more protests which might mean that the coefficient associated with Ontario Province or larger population maybe larger in magnitude than the other coefficients. However most of the provinces have very few protests ever year compared to the top 3.
```{r}
# ---- Looking at numbers themselves--------------------------------------------

# Number of no protests in different Months and Provinces
zero_protests <- 0
for (i in data$protests){
  if (i == 0) {
    zero_protests <- zero_protests + 1
  }
}

print(paste("there are total of", zero_protests,
            "times where there were no protest"))


# Mean and Variance of number of protests
protest_mean <- mean(data$protests)
protest_var <- var(data$protests)
print(paste("the mean of number of protests is",
            protest_mean, "and the variance is", protest_var))


```
---- Selecting the Best Model---------------------------------------------------

Regression Model I am going to use:
We know that Poisson Distribution assumes that mean and variance are equal. However we earlier saw that the mean is smaller than variance by a large magnitude, thus I do not think Poisson Distribution is a good starting point to make my model.

After reading the paper Ver Hoef, J. M., & Boveng, P. L. (2007). Quasi‐Poisson vs. negative binomial regression: how should we model over dispersed count data?. Ecology, 88(11), 2766-277.

I need to decide on whether I would want to put more "weight" on lower means of protests by provinces or more weight on provinces with higher mean of protests.

To decide this I would see the overall population and protest dispersion over whole of Canada.
```{r}
# ----population and protest dispersion over whole of Canada--------------------
province_pop <- data.frame(
  id=data$prov[1:13],
  population=data$pop[1:13])

province_pop$pop_percentage <-
  province_pop$population/sum(province_pop$population) * 100

province_pop$protest_percentage <- 
  protests_by_province$Protests/sum(protests_by_province$Protests) * 100

province_pop

```
Now since our objective is to predict protests across whole of Canada and since most (almost all except BC and Ontario) of the provinces actually have very small means of protests, I am leaning towards using a Negative Binomial Regression so that the lower mean of protest provinces have some weights and not just a number really close to 0.

Note that we also saw that there are a lot of zeros in this data set (45) of them, thus I am also going to try a zero-inflated model paired up with Negative Binomial Regression.

We also need to look at the independent-dependent variable scatter plots just to make sure we don't need to apply transformations to decrease the skewness or linearize some variables
```{r}
#----Variable Transformation----------------------------------------------------
plot((data$pop), data$protests, main = "Scatter Plot", xlab = "Population", 
     ylab = "Protests", col = "black", pch = 16)

#If we apply log transformation to population datta not only the number are 
# smaller and easier to manage but also looks more linearized
plot(log(data$pop), data$protests, main = "Scatter Plot",
     xlab = "log(Population)", ylab = "Protests", col = "black", pch = 16)
```
```{r}
# -----Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Model------------------------------------
# I am going to use province as the predictor for the zero part of the model due
#to the case that some states just record a lot lower protests and closer to 0 
# for the negative binomial model itself i will include all the 
#rest of the variables.

model <- zeroinfl(protests ~ data$year + data$month + log(data$pop)|  data$prov,
                  data=data, dist="negbin")
summary(model)
```



#---- Bootstrapping ----------------------------------------------------
```{r}

boot_function <- function(data, indices) {
  resampled_data <- data[indices, ] # Creating a bootstrap sample
  model_boot <- zeroinfl(protests ~ year + month + log(pop)|  prov , 
                         data=resampled_data, dist="negbin") # Fitting the model
  return(coef(model_boot)) # Returning the model coefficients

boot_results <- suppressWarnings(boot(data, boot_function, R=500))
